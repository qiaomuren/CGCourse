This is the online course taught by [Ling-Qi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/index.html) in Chinese.
* There are **eight assignments** and **one final project**. All eight assignments only need Eigen, OpenCV except assignment 8.
* My overall grade is **114.81 / 115**. 
* Course Homepage can be found [here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html).

## Assignment 1: Rotation and Projection
### Requirements
* Build the model matrix and the perspective projection matrix correctly
* Press the key to rotate the triangle or use the command line to get the rotated image
* [Bonus] Build the model matrix to rotate the triangle around any axis through the origin
### Results (grade: 35 / 35)

## Assignment 2: Triangles and Z-buffering
### Requirements
* Implement triangle rasterization algorithm
* Implement z-buffer algorithm and  draw triangles on the screen in order
* [Bonus] Implement super-sampling algorithm (anti-aliasing)
### Results (grade: 50 / 50)
* Raw result
